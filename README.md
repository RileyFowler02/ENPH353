# KEIRAN I SET UP THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR YOU SO PLEASE JUST USE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT I HAVE SET UP IT SHOULD ALREADY HAVE ALL THE DEPENDENCIES SET UP 

## TO SET UP THE REPO:
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GIT INSTALLED, IF YOU DO NOT, GO INSTALL IT FROM THE WEBSITE AND ADD IT TO YOUR PATH

`cd/path/to/desired/repo/location` - CHANGE THE PATH TO WHERE YOU WANT THE LOCAL VERSION OF THE REPO TO BE STORED

`git clone https://github.com/RileyFowler02/ENPH353.git` - CLONES THE REPO TO YOUR MACHINE IN THE PWD

`cd repository` - OPENS THE WORKSPACE


## OKAY NOW WE SET UP THE VENV
`source .venv/bin/activate`

AND THEN SELECT THE .VENV KERNAL IN THE TOP RIGHT OF YOUR VSCODE

## HERE IS A QUICK REFERENCE FOR COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
